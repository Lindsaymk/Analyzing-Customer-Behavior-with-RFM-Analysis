# Analyzing-Customer-Behavior-with-RFM-Analysis

## Project Overview

This data analysis project focuses on conducting RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on a dataset from an e-commerce platform. RFM analysis is a powerful method for segmenting customers based on their transaction behaviors and identifying high-value customer segments.

## Dataset

- The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [(https://statso.io/rfm-analysis-case-study/)].

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Comprehensive data cleaning had already been performed on the original dataset using Python to ensure data accuracy and consistency. 

2. **RFM Calculation**:
   - Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores were computed for each customer.

3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Utilizing the RFM scores, customers were segmented into distinct groups representing different behavior patterns.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Data visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and segmentation summaries, were created using Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib or Seaborn) to provide insights into customer behavior.

5. **Findings and Recommendations**:
   - Key findings and actionable recommendations were derived from the RFM analysis, informing marketing and business strategies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script file in your preferred Python environment.

3. Execute the code cells or script sequentially to replicate the analysis.
